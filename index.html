                For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
                that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
                everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to
                condemn the world; but that the world through him might be
                saved.
              </p>

              <p>
                He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
                not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the
                name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the
                condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
                darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
              </p>

              <p>
                For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh
                to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that
                doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made
                manifest, that they are wrought in God.
